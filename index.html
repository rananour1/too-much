           <td class="demo"> manifested in a sense of compulsion to play, social isolation, mood swings, diminished imagination, and excessive focus on success in the game, leading to the abandonment of other activities in life.  In May 2013, the American Psychiatric Association proposed criteria for video game addiction in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, concluding that there was insufficient evidence to include it as a stand-alone psychiatric disorder. However, the proposed criteria for 'Internet Gaming Disorder' have been included in Section 3, 'Conditions for further study'. While Internet gaming disorder is proposed as a disorder, it is still debated whether this disorder is caused by the gaming activities themselves, or whether it is the result of other disorders. Inconsistencies in research on video game addiction may reflect more general inconsistencies in video game research, for example, some research has linked violent video games with an increase in a person's aggressive behavior,  while other research has failed to find evidence for these links.</td>
